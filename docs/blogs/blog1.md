# Blog 1

I found this lecture with Lyel fascinating, perhaps because it align eerily with the things I've been thinking about in terms of my career, but mainly because it gave me examples of people following the path of public interest technology and being incredibly "successful" at it.

One thing that lingered in my mind, was this idea I've heard that perhaps technology isn't always the solution to our societal problems. The damage that technology has caused is deeply apparent, from the enabling of a surveillence state to the betterment of military weapons like missile guidance systems that kill thousands of innocent civilians. 

I think its certainly worth considering, when we're thinking about responsible innovation, whether or not we need to be innovating in a certain field in the first place. Yes, change is necessary to stop and possible reverse the negative effects of Big Tech. But, does that change need to utilize new technology, like AI for example, that  does more damage than it does good (i.e the insane amount of energy consumption needed to power these AI systems)?

Should we fight fire with fire? I'm sure this varies depending on which issues we're talking about, but its a question that shouldn't go unasked nonetheless.
