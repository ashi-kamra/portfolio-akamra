# Assignment 2: Divergent Design #
In this stage of the development process, I brainstormed the features, applications, and long-terms impacts of my app.

## The Application Goals ##
**Name**: Haven <br>
**Audience**: People of all ages, but primarily young users and users with small social circles <br>
**Values**: Haven is an app that provides individuals a space to <br>
1. Escape dangerous people lurking on social media
2. Invest their time and energy into existing relationships
3. Make intentional and safe connections

## The Comparables ##
1. iMessage DM Interface
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]
Could use this graphical representation of contacts as the central focus of Haven

2. Instagram internal DM Interface
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]
Could use the dynamic colors and ability to change the background to make the conversations you have more personal and fun!

3. Instagram/Snapchat Stories
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]
Could use the stories feature on instagram and snapchat to make a similar feature of temporary videos/photos you want to send to a group of contacts

4. Instagram Mutual Friends Feature
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]
Could use Instagrams ability to see mutual friends, but make it more prominent and centralized

5. Pinterest Boards
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]
Could use this kind of collaborative photo dumping feature to allow people to store/share photos with people and groups

6. Apple Maps Starring Locations
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]
Could apply this ability to start and save locations to peoples conversations and messages (saving quotes that are funny)
