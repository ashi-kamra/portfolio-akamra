# Assignment 2: Divergent Design #
In this stage of the development process, I brainstormed the features, applications, and long-terms impacts of my app.

## The Application Goals ##
**Name**: Haven <br>
**Audience**: People of all ages, but primarily young users and users with small social circles <br>
**Values**: Haven is an app that provides individuals a space to <br>
1. Escape dangerous people lurking on social media
2. Invest their time and energy into existing relationships
3. Make intentional and safe connections

## The Comparables ##
1. iMessage DM Interface<br>
![iMessage DM Interface](./comparable1.png)<br>
Could use this graphical representation of contacts as the central focus of Haven


2. Instagram internal DM Interface<br>
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]<br>
Could use the dynamic colors and ability to change the background to make the conversations you have more personal and fun!

3. Instagram/Snapchat Stories<br> 
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]<br>
Could use the stories feature on instagram and snapchat to make a similar feature of temporary videos/photos you want to send to a group of contacts

4. Instagram Mutual Friends Feature <br>
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]<br>
Could use Instagrams ability to see mutual friends, but make it more prominent and centralized

5. Pinterest Boards <br>
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]<br>
Could use this kind of collaborative photo dumping feature to allow people to store/share photos with people and groups

6. Apple Maps Starring Locations<br>
[INSERT IMAGE HERE]<br>
Could apply this ability to start and save locations to peoples conversations and messages (saving quotes that are funny)

## The Brainstorm ##
1. **Connector** - central feature that connects users once given private id's of user1 and user2
2. **Lack of Username Search** - cannot add someone by searching for their name in a database (only by putting them in the connector)<br>
3. **Safety Spotlight** - as an introduction to the app, users are informed about CSAM on social media and are given resources to help<br>
4. **Mutual Friend Finder** - feature that notifies user if they have mutual friends and displays those friends. Includes option to block user if no mutual friends<br>
5. **Cut the Connection** - On each connections profile, there is a button to report this person for CSAM/SA. Leads to immediate legal action against them and blocks them. (More extreme than reporting them)<br>
6. **Emergency Connections** - ability to label some contacts as trusted sources/emergency contacts. Limited to 3. They will be notified when user "cuts connection"<br>
7. **Help Hotlines** - feature to call mental health, sexual assault hotline, or 911
8. **Consent Survey** - tracking feature that analyzes sent photos and if sexually explicit, surveys user if they consented to receive it or not. Only able to revoke consent in 3 days. <br>
9. **Burning** - Permanently deletes a photo (on both users' ends) that a user flags they did not consent to receive <br>
10. **Haven** - Central feature displaying your connections in graph structure
11. **Memories** - Collection of photos/videos shared bewteen connections that are available on a users profile
12. **RSVPs** - Ability to propose and send hangout invitations to connections by filling out a form
13. **Echoing** - Starring text messages to save as quotes to a connections profile
14. **Mood Signaling** - Ability to signal mood (through emojis) to connections and have it displayed on their Havens
15. **Podcast Room** - Ability to store and record audio chats between connections
16. **Hangout Tracking** - Tracking feature that allows you to visualizes in a calendar when you last made plans/hung out with a connection
17. **Calendar Integration** - External calendar integration to display availability between connections
18. **Connection Anniversary** - Feature that notifies user of anniversary of when they connected with someone
19. **Message Scheduling** - Feature to send messages at a chosen time and date in the future
20. **Glimpses** - Temporary videos/images a user can post for all their connections to see.
