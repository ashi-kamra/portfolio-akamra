# Assignment 6 - User Testing and Review #
In this final assignment, I will test my app out with selected users to evaluate how they interact with the app and whether their needs were met and whether my design goals were implemented well.

## Pre-populated Data ##
Because Haven is a direct messaging social media app, the only pre-populated data I can include is existing users for them to connect with. Thus, I added 5 dummy users for the user to connect with and message.

## Task List ##
| Title | Instruction | Reasoning |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Register | User will register a new account with the app | This is a prequisite action to all other functions in Haven |
| Connect | User will make a connection with another existing user in the app | Connecting with friends online is a central feature as Haven is a social media app who goal is to strengthening existing friendships. I hope to learn whether users will feel like connection is a more complex process then on normal social media platforms, as that was intended for safety concerns. |
| Message | User will send a message and will respond to a message received by that new connection | Because Haven is a DM social media app, messaging is one of the central feature that must be tested to see if its functional, and is Discoverable (in terms of Usability heuristic), as that was the intention behind the implementation. | 
| Update username | Users will change their username to a new username by inputting this information to the app | Again, i'd like to test the Discoverability of this feature, and see if they understand the principle that you aren't meant to change your id. |
| Navigate | Users will navigate around the app, clicking different links to take them to different pages | I want to see if the users feel like the app is consistent in its linguistic heuristics, and also error tolerant if they click the wrong link. |
| Access Id | User will attempt to click a button in order to view their unique private id. | I want to test the error tolerance of this feature, and Fitt's law, to see if it is too easily reachable, as that would undermine intentions about safety.|
| Log out and log back in | Users will log out of the app, and input the necessary information to try and log back in | Similar to testing connection, users should feel as though logging in and out is more complex/tedious, and will be deterred from it for safety thus testing the Discoverability heuristic.|
