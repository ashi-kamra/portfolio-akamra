# Assignment 1: Needfinding #

This assignment marked the beginning of my journey designing a social media app

## The Hunch ##
Child endangerment and abuse is rampanant on social media platforms, especially Snapchat and Instagram. How can we design a platform that protects young users and prevents child endangerment?

---

## The Planning ##
I first had to understand the scale of the problem, and what exactly about the platforms made them enable child endangerment.

After reading articles from the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html), it seemed as though the problem stems from the balance between **surveillance** and **privacy** employed on these apps. 

**More privacy = more endangerment as predatory users easily go unnoticed**
**More surveillance = more individual data collection, which is unwanted for users not impacted by CSAM**

With that in mind, I wanted my interviewees to be two of different types of parties involved in online CSAM: the children potentially in danger, and the guardians responsible for their safety.
