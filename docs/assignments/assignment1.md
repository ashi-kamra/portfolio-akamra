# Assignment 1: Needfinding #

This assignment marked the beginning of my journey designing a social media app

---

## The Hunch ##
Child endangerment and abuse is rampanant on social media platforms, especially Snapchat and Instagram. How can we design a platform that protects young users and prevents child endangerment?

---

## The Planning ##
I first had to understand the scale of the problem, and what exactly about the platforms made them enable child endangerment.

After reading articles from the NYTimes, it seemed as though the problem stems from the balance between surveillance and privacy employed on these apps. 

** More privacy = more endangerment as predatory users easily go unnoticed **
** More surveillance = more individual data collection, which is unwanted for users not impacted by CSAM**
