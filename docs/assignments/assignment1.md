# Assignment 1: Needfinding #

This assignment marked the beginning of my journey designing a social media app

## The Hunch ##
Child endangerment and abuse is rampanant on social media platforms, especially Snapchat and Instagram. How can we design a platform that protects young users and prevents child endangerment?

## The Planning ##
I first had to understand the scale of the problem, and what exactly about the platforms made them enable child endangerment.

After reading articles from the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html), it seemed as though the problem stems from the balance between **surveillance** and **privacy** employed on these apps. 

**More privacy = more endangerment** as predatory users easily go unnoticed<br>
**More surveillance = more individual data collection** which is unwanted for users not impacted by CSAM

With that in mind, I wanted my interviewees to be two of different types of parties involved in online CSAM: the minors potentially in danger, and the guardians responsible for their safety. The individuals I chose specifically started using social media at very different ages, for different purposes. Their different genders also means they valued safety on social media distinctly. This allowed me a wide range of perspectives/experiences to draw upon.

3. Why do you use them?
4. How long have you been using them/how did you get introduced?

5. What do you typically do on social media?
6. How do you meet new people on X, Y, Z
7. Does anyone in your family/friends use them? 
8. What kind of thing do you look out for when adding/friending someone you don’t know?
9. How do you think about online safety/privacy as a guardian/child?

10. What are some of your favorite/least favorite memories on social media platforms?11. How do you handle any negative experience?
12. Has social media changed the way you approach social interactions/meeting new people?
13. When do you feel the safest on social media? 
14. When do you feel the least safe on social media?

## The Interviews ##

### Arini: 16, Female, High School Student ###
Arini is very well acquainted with social media. As a user of apps like Instagram, Tiktok and Snapchat since she was in 6th grade, she thinks of herself ‘like everyone her age.” She mainly uses social media to communicate with her friends or watch entertaining videos. Sometimes, she even posts videos on tiktok herself. That decision between posting on a private story versus a public story/account is mainly based on who she wants to see the content. She’s aware of the dangers lurking, when “random people” add her on Snapchat or view her public Tiktoks. As such, posting publicly is often when she feels the most at risk on social media. But, if she comes across a suspicious account, the first thing she checks for, across all platforms, is if they have <font color="blue">mutual friends</font>. That seemed to be the most important factor to determine if someone is dangerous or not. But, she’ll also check if they have any public available posts, and how many followers they have. The more followers, the less suspicious because “it's not easy to just buy [thousands of] followers.” 

> Key Note: Determining someones danger level comes from the number of connections and the kind of connections you have with them. Almost like an automatic social vetting process. 

In fact, online safety is something her parents have warned her about since she first started using these platforms. “They’ve told me alot, oh, digital footprint, and all these things. The last thing I want is for some stupid mistake to prevent me from going to college.” Arini has experienced random adults following her, and attempting to communicate, but because of this <font color="blue">safety rhetoric early-on</font>, she makes sure to be extremely careful and blocks those users immediately. But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have fun. For Arini, communication with already established relationships is her main goal for using social media platforms, not going viral or becoming a content creator (though she recognizes the possibility for that to happen). 

> Key Note: Being educated about online safety increases a user's wariness and caution about friending potential online predators.

### Smitha: 46, Female, Professor ###
Smitha considers herself a kind of utilitarian when it comes to social media. She’s not one to succumb to social hype or pressure around using new apps. “If I don’t need it, I don’t use it,” as she puts it. Utility, for her, comes in two forms. Communicating with established relationships, and networking for professional opportunities. Using apps like Facebook and Whatsapp, she’ll message long-time friends and family from around the globe with updates about her family and her own well-being. Instagram and Linkedin is what she uses to advertise her work in academia and the dance troupe she leads. For these more professional accounts, she, somewhat reluctantly, finds herself in a more active role, posting her/the troupe's accomplishments to gain a wider audience and interest in her work. But, her personal life is another story completely. Though she has friends who post about their loved one’s, Smitha is passionate about not having her family be perceived as accomplishments to elevate her status. She doesn’t feel the need for external social affirmation that these apps often provide. “The people whom I really want to see my kids, and whom I really want to be involved in their lives, I’ll send it to them individually.” While social media is often used to create new relationships with people, Smitha is not interested in using it in that way. Regardless of whether it's harder to meet new people at an old age or because she simply doesn’t have the time, she would rather spend time <font color="blue">strengthening the connections she already has than</font> building a new network.

> Key Note: There is a lack of interest in using social media to meet new people nowaday. Instead direct messaging platforms seem to satisfy peoples needs for their personal relationships.

As a mother of two children, Smitha has certainly given some thought to her kids' social media usage. Her oldest, a 15 year old non-binary artist, often says things along the lines of “evil comes to you in strange ways” in regards to social media, and thus refuses to use Instagram. They opt for Pinterest and Tumblr instead. Her younger one, a 11 year old boy who uses Youtube, isn’t allowed a phone as Smitha is wary of the mental health risks posed by social media. Documentaries like “The Social Dilemma” and research about the impact of early social media usage has proven to Smitha and her children that nothing good comes of it at that young an age. That doesn’t mean that her children won’t be exposed to dangerous content on the internet or any other platforms they use. So, instead of policing her kids' social media use, Smitha invests in building a trusting relationship between her and her kids, allowing them to communicate with her about any danger they encounter with no fear of judgement. “Sometimes we’ll talk about sexual content or violent content… I take comfort in the fact that they want to talk to me about that stuff.” For Smitha, <font color="blue">building a safe space at home </font> is what protects her kids online.  

> Key Note: Having trusted adults/relationships in a users's life protects them from encountering the same dangerous content repeatedly. 


## The Re-Design ##
### Opportunity 1: Deliberate Friending ###
The ease with which predator's can add/friend a individual by simply searching their username on the platform allows them to quickly find potential victims. To prevent "random" people adding potential victims, a user would be assigned a unique and private id that must be directly shared by said user to the potential friend (and vice versa) in order to add them. This re-design ensures that users would be making social connections more intentionally, and would keep their posts/information much more private than if it could be searched by other users. 

### Opportunity 2: Emphasize Mutual Friends ###
Based on the importance of having mutual friends in online safety, I see an opportunity to make that information more apparent. When adding a user, a screen would pop up to display any mutual friends you share. And, if you share no mutual friends, a warning would appear to notify users of this lack, and an option would appear to block them or continue with the friending. This redesign ensure that users are well informed of whether this person is completely stranger. It takes advantage of the "automatic social vetting process" to better protect potential victims, when this information can be easily overlooked on current social media platforms.

### Opportunity 3: DM-Centric Social Media ###
Both interviewees mentioned how their main goal using social media apps is to reinforce existing relationships. Based on this priority, I see an opportunity to design an app structured as a hybrid between direct messaging apps like Instagram and Whatsapp. That way the direct messaging features that foster a stronger personal connection is centered, but with additional popular features like stories, users can still utilize the more entertaining features.
