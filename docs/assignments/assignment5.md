# Assignment 5: Final Front-end Design and Implementation #
In this assignment, I begin to implement the client side of my web app, conducting heuristic evaluations and visual design studies to inform my development of the front-end.

## Heuristic Self-Evaluations ##
Based on this wireframe: https://www.figma.com/design/EXVqFTV82VI4RUgPvlKq3W/61040-Haven-Prototype?node-id=8-262&node-type=frame&t=opKW61ObKf0bruMU-0

**1. Usability criteria**
*Discoverability:* The users will be able to understand how to use the messaging, and homepage parts of the platform easily as they are similar to other popular social media/DMing platforms, but the connecting and consent survey part might be less intuitive as they are novel features, though with written instructions I included it should be alright. 

*Error Tolerance*: If users make errors, say clicking on a different connection than the one they wanted to message, or mistyping the id of someone they'd like to connect to, there aren't any current features to obvious remedy those. I'll be sure to **include "back" buttons/arrows, or "undo" buttons**, or **specifying if that id matches to any existent user**. 

**2.Physical heuristics**
*Fittâ€™s Law*: Nothing is too far out of reach, similarly all the more pertinent features are towards the center of the screen, whereas some of the features users can opt out of are (like echoes) near the corners. Even though the navigation buttons are towards the bottom, it's in line with where users thumbs are.  

*Perceptual Fusion*: The wireframe doesn't include any features to account for time delays, which may occur when fetching large sets of data like for the echoes or processing time for making a connection. I think I'll include **spinning wheels** or **loading messages** to fix this.

**3. Linguistic level**
*Speak a user's language*: The wireframe does provide helpful written information to guide the users behavior, but it may be too descriptive or clunky. I'll consider **shortening it and making these descriptions more punchy and clear**.

*Consistency*: Yes, the wireframe uses symbols that are consistent in their meaning and function.
